Swift/T HELP

swift-t <options> <program.swift>
Compiles program.swift with STC and runs it with Turbine

You may provide STC and/or Turbine options.
When there is a conflict, STC takes precedence.  
Use swift-t -t to pass arguments through to Turbine. 
For example, to provide an MPICH hosts file, use: 
swift-t -t f:hosts.txt program.swift
