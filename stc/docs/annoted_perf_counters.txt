Task counters
=============
# worktype_0 == worker tasks
# worktype_1 == control tasks and notifications
# parallel == parallel tasks
# targeted == targeted tasks (usually data notifications)
# single   == regular tasks
# net      == total tasks going through system
# total    == total tasks, with stolen tasks double-counted
# bypass   == matched immediately to receiver
# enqueued == added to queue, no receiver right now
