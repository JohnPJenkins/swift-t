= ExM Parser Test Suite

== Overview

The official documentation is at:
https://sites.google.com/site/exmproject/development/parser---usage#TOC-Test-suite

We compile each Swift script to the corresponding Tcl script, then run
Turbine on it.

Use +run-tests.zsh+ to run the tests.  This automates the following
simplified command lines:
----
stc 100-test.swift 100-test.tcl
mpiexec -n 3 turbine 100-test.tcl
----

This creates stc logs, intermediate code, and output files.

== Numbering

The tests are numbered for sorting by shell glob.

000::       Script fragments, noops, assert()s
100::       Basic function calls, errors
200::       Conditionals, recursion, expressions
300::       Arrays, structs
400::       For loops
500::       Types
        590: blobs
600::       User builtins, interesting CPP uses
700::       STC standard library
        700: strings
        710: argc/argv
        730: stdio
        780: MPE
800::       Error outputs
900::       ??? Formerly advanced constructs

== Clean

Use ./clean.sh to clean up files created by the test suite
