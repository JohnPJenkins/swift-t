Enabling running ordinary C code as Swift/T application on IBM BG-style supercomputers
=======================================================================================

Motivation:

Since the target computing environment does not allow fork/exec on compute nodes, an alternative approach is to tightly couple existing codes into the Swift/T framework and run it as a single piece of code.

The benefit to users is ease of application composability while still being able to have high performance from execution.

The package contains the following files:

About.txt:
extension.c:
helpers.h: ?
Makefile: Make file to generate shared library from source code
make-package.tcl
prog-c.c : main program a la application code
prog-swift.swift
prog-tcl.tcl
run.sh: run script.
swift-main.c
swift-main.h: Header file to declare functions defined in Swift main.
swift-main.i
swift-main.tcl
