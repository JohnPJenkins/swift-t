Enabling running ordinary C code as Swift/T application on IBM BG-style supercomputers
=======================================================================================

Motivation:
Since the target computing environment does not allow fork/exec on compute
nodes, an alternative approach is to tightly couple existing codes into the
Swift/T framework and run it as a single piece of code.

The benefit to users is ease of application composability while still being
able to take advantage of high-level expressivity and high performance from
execution.

The package contains the following files:

About.txt: The current file.
prog-c.c : main program a la application code
extension.c: Injects an ability to call c function with TCL 
helpers.h: ?
make-package.tcl:
prog-swift.swift: High level Swift script defining 
prog-tcl.tcl: 
swift-main.c: 
swift-main.h: Header file to declare functions defined in Swift main.
swift-main.i: 
swift-main.tcl: 
Makefile: Make file to generate shared library from source code
run.sh: run script.
