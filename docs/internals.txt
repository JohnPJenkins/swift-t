Overview
--------

This manual provides an index of important concepts internal to
Turbine.

Quick Start
-----------

The fastest way to get a quick overview of provided features is to just run:

--------------------------------------------------------
./setup.sh
./configure --with-adlb=<PATH/TO/ADLB>
            --with-mpi=<PATH/TO/MPICH>
            --with-tcl=<PATH/TO/TCL>
make package

Note:

PATH/TO/ADLB  : Points to source tree
PATH/TO/MPICH : Points to installed location
PATH/TO/TCL   : Points to installed location
--------------------------------------------------------

Then, just take a look at the test code and output to see how things
work.

TCL Packaging
-------------

Turbine consists of two libraries, ADLB and Turbine, packaged as TCL
extensions, and several TCL script libraries.  All of this is packaged
with TCL conventions in +lib+.  Cf. +lib/make-package.tcl+ and
+lib/module.mk.in+.

To bring these extensions and libraries into a TCL script, we use:

--------------------------------------------------------
package require turbine 0.1
--------------------------------------------------------

This command refers to environment variable +TCLLIBPATH+, which we
set in +bin/turbine+.

MPI Process Modes
-----------------

A Turbine program is a TCL script launched as an SPMD program by
+mpiexec+.  In general, the idea is to do

--------------------------------------------------------
mpiexec -l -n ${N} tclsh something.tcl
--------------------------------------------------------

In our case, we provide a helper script.  So in the test cases, we run

--------------------------------------------------------
mpiexec -l -n ${N} bin/turbine test/something.tcl
--------------------------------------------------------

The Turbine MPI environment is set by the +mpiexec -n+ number and the
inputs to +turbine::init+.  As a result, each MPI process will become
a Turbine Engine, Turbine Worker, or ADLB Server.  Turbine Engines and
Workers are workers from the perspective of ADLB.

Turbine Engine::

Processes Turbine dependency rules.  Cf. +lib/engine.tcl:engine+.
Runs on the lowest MPI ranks.  Rank 0 calls the user +rules+
procedure, starting the program.  Work from this procedure may be
distributed to other engines.

Turbine Worker::

Processes leaf work units.  Cf. +lib/engine.tcl:worker+.  Runs on the
middle MPI ranks.

ADLB Server::

Performs ADLB services.  Enters +ADLB_Server()+ and does not exit
until the run is complete.
Cf. +src/tcl/adlb/tcl-adlb.c::ADLB_Init_Cmd()+.  Runs on the highest
MPI ranks.

Turbine concepts
----------------

TR::

Turbine makes progress by evaluating Turbine rules (TRs).  A rule has
an ID, a name (primarily for debugging), a state (waiting, ready,
running, complete, and a transform.  A transform has a list of input
TDs, output TDs, and an executor that does actual work.  The executor
is usually a TCL command string that is processed via TCL +eval+.  The
function body targeted by the executor can contain arbitrary TCL code,
lookup data from the given TDs, launch external processes via TCL
+exec+ and store TDs.

TR IDs are represented in the log as +{ID}+.

TD::

A Turbine datum.  Represented in TCL by a 64-bit TD ID.  A TD may be
open (unset) or closed (set).  TD IDs are represented in the log as
+<ID>+.  Current types include:

* string
* integer
* container
* file
+

TP::

A Turbine procedure.  If an executor is prefixed with +tp:+, it will
only be processed by an engine.

TF::

A Turbine function.  If an executor is prefixed with +tf:+, it will
only be processed by a worker.

Container::

Element from which Turbine data structures are created.  May be used
to create associative arrays, structs, and stack frames.  Represented
by a TD.  A TD plus a subscript results in another TD.
+
Container operations are represented in the log as, e.g., +<4>:k=<8>+,
indicating that container TD 4 with subscript "k" resulted in TD 8.

Subscribe::

TRs are stored in the distributed rule engines.  To make progress,
these TRs are activated when their input data is ready.  Thus, the
rule engines subscribe to data stored in ADLB and are notified when
data is ready.

ADLB Modifications
------------------

Turbine uses ADLB to distribute tasks and locate data.

All Turbine variables are stored in a customized data store built into
ADLB.  This required the construction of additional ADLB API calls.

The following ADLB features are available to Turbine.  They are used
internally by the Turbine features, they are not called directly by
the user script.  Cf. +src/tcl/adlb/tcl-adlb.c+.

adlb::SUCCESS::

Variable represents +ADLB_SUCCESS+.

adlb::ANY::

Variable represents "any", which is -1 in ADLB.

adlb::init <servers> <types>::

Start ADLB with the given number of servers and work types.

adlb::finalize::

Stop ADLB.

adlb::put <reserve_rank> <work type> <work unit>::

Submit a work unit as a string of given integer type.  Sent to given
rank, which may be +adlb::ANY+.

adlb::get <req_type> <answer_rank>::

Get a work unit as a string of given integer type, which may be
+adlb::ANY+.  ADLB answer rank stored in +answer_rank+.

adlb::create <id> <data>::

Instantiate the given data but do not close it.  Data may be:

* +string:+
* +integer:+
* +container:<type>+
  where +type+ is the type of the container keys.
* +file:<name>+
  where +name+ is the file name.

adlb::store <id> <data>::

Store the TD.

adlb::retrieve <id>::

Retrieve the TD.

adlb::insert <id> <subscript> <member>::

Store TD +member+ at the given +subscript+ in container +id+.

adlb::lookup <id> <subscript>::

Obtain the TD for the given +subscript+ in container +id+.

ADLB_Subscribe(id)::

ADLB modification.  Called only by Turbine rule processing.  Request
that the calling rank be notified when TD +id+ is closed.

adlb::close <id>::

Close TD +id+.  Returns a list of ranks that must be notified.

adlb::unique::

Return a unique TD.
